The contents of the texmf-local directory are custom LaTeX tools
used in the compilation of the .tex files in this directory.
They are invoked by LaTeX macros like \econtex which substitute the proper relative filepaths at the appropriate points in the LaTeX document
The paths for each component mirror those that would be appropriate for the files to be installed in a local LaTeX installation
